        <h2>Emmet</h2>
        <h3>Emmet Part 1</h3>
        <p>The guy from the lego movie.</p>
        <p>You know, the really normal one.</p>
        <p>The one who served as really convenient merchandising material.</p>
        <h3>Emmet Part 2</h3>
        <p>Para 1</p>
        <p>Para 2</p>
        <p>Para 3</p>
        <h3>Emmet 3</h3>
        <p>Not that part 2 really said anything.</p>
        <p>But manually assigning text to all of the paragraphs with solely Emmet would be really tedious. If even possible in the first place.</p>
        <p>BUT I was able to generate the figure with the image and caption below using only Emmet, which I think is pretty cool.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Emmet.png" alt="Emmet.">
            <figcaption>Emmet.</figcaption>
        </figure>
