        <h2>Project 1 Proposal</h2>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>Throughout the course of this project, I will be developing for
        my client a website intended to teach students interesting in learning
        programming how to do so in the C programming language. My client will
        provide me with the necessary information to create a website that will
        teach users the basics of C programming from a non-computer science
        student perspective. The pages of the site will cover basic topics such as
        variables, pointers, and functions, much of which will be interactive to
        give the user a hands-on experience in further understand how code works.
        </p>
        <h3>Client Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Alex Mccomas</li>
            <li>UNC Charlotte</li>

        <h3>Page Design</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Home</strong> - Contains introductory information on the programming
            language C, intended to break down the idea of programming and the purpose of this
            site for those visiting it for the first time, and presumably those who are less
            experienced with computer science in general. This page will not have any interactive
            elements, intended solely to introduce the learning user to the rest of the site.</li>
            <li><strong>Variables</strong> - This page will explain the concept of variables in
            computer programming, serving as the preface page to the subsequent child pages that
            will discuss each individual variable type. This page (like all of the pages on this
            site) will be intended to educate the viewer on the subject it is named after. In this
            case, C variables and what they are used for. The Variables page and all of its child pages
            in the sublist below will not contain interactive elements, simply explaining the use of
            variables while providing examples.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>char</strong> - Will explain the use of char type variables in C
                programming, and what they are used for.</li>
                <li><strong>int</strong> - Will explain the use of int type variables in C
                    programming, and what they are used for.</li>
                <li><strong>float</strong> - Will explain the use of float type variables in C
                    programming, and what they are used for.</li>
                <li><strong>string</strong> - Will explain the use of strings in C
                    programming, and what they are used for.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Pointers</strong> - This page will explain the concept of pointers in C
            programming, and how they work in practice. The page will include interactive elements
            to provide the user a hands-on experience in learning how pointers function.</li>
            <li><strong>Loops</strong> - This page will introduce the various types of loops used
            in C programming, and how each one operates. This webpage will feature interactive elements
            that display the functionality of each loop, and how they differ from one another in their
            respective iterations.</li>
            <li><strong>Functions</strong> - In this page, the user will be provided with information on
            how functions work in C programming. interactive elements will also be used here in order to
            help students understand how parameters, return values, and other aspects of functions work in
            this language.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
        <p>Throughout this website, JavaScript will be utilized to allow users to modify the code in faux C
        programs, allowing them to experiment with code to see how it will affect the output. Users will be allowed
        to change variable values, types, pointers, and other aspects of the code to see how it will affect the execution.
