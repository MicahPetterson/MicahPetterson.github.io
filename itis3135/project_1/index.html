        <h1>Oh, How Great is C!</h1>
        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Welcome to programming! You are in for such a treat on this wonderful topic and we are just gonna start by talking about
        programming in general. Have you ever wondered how the internet works, how apps are able to run, video games able to work,
        or even just how your laptop does so many things? Well all of this is due to programming, albeit different types of programming,
        but it still all works because of code. So now you see that programming is in everything electronic, doesn't that make you even
        more curious about the subject as a whole? Well if so this website is for you, as we will talk about each of these subjects:</p>
        <ul id = "subject-list">
            <li><a href = "variables.html">Variables</a></li>
            <li><a href = "pointers.html">Pointers</a></li>
            <li><a href = "arrays.html">Arrays</a></li>
            <li><a href = "loops.html">Loops</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these topics is very important to programming in C and for the most part understanding the basics of programming as
        a whole. Pointers is the special one in this case, as there are not pointers in other programming languages such as Java,
        Python, etc. as there is in C and C++. As you will learn later on in your life if you continue to learn about programming is
        that C is a great language to build upon and a great language to learn as your first. Enjoy your journey!</p>
