        <h1>Pointers</h1>
        <p>Now welcome to a very different type of declaration than what we discussed in the variables
        page. This topic is one that is pretty difficult to understand at first as it is the first
        time that we are talking about the memory addresses of variables. No don't freak out, it's not
        that bad I promise!</p>
        <p>Each computer has memory that it can allocate things to. Now, our variables that we create
        need to exist somewhere (they aren't just floating out in space) and this memory in the
        computer is exactly where these variables and their data are stored. Each location that a
        variable is stored at is given a “memory address” that we can actually see! We can see and use
        these addresses by using pointers.</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int* numberAddress;</p>
        </div>

        <p>Now the way we give these pointers an actual address to a variable, is to assign it the
        address of a variable. We do that by referencing the variable and putting “&” in front of it.
        Take our x variable from earlier, it will look something like this:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int x = 5;</p>
            <p>int* numberAddress = &x;</p>
        </div>

        <p>If you put this into a computer and print it on the console it might look something like this:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>1072256188</p>
        </div>

        <p>Now that just looks like a bunch of random numbers, but that group of numbers tells the computer
        where to find the data for that variable.</p>

        <p>This is cool and all, but why are pointers important? Well, funny you should ask. Pointers
        are useful to us because they allow us to manipulate the data in the main memory in a way that
        reduces code and improves performance all at once. It is also useful further in your computer
        science career because we can use pointers to implement multiple different data structures.</p>
