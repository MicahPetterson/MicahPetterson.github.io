        <h1>Arrays</h1>
        <p>Oh arrays, like everything else we have talked about so far this is a very important
        part to programming and is one of the fundamentals you must know about if you are going
        to code any important piece of software.</p>

        <p>We have already gone over variables and how they can hold information, arrays are
        kinda like that but they can hold a lot more information than a single variable can.
        Think of a variable as a package that holds one item(data), an array is like the truck
        that package came on. Arrays can hold different data but the caveat to that is that all
        of the data in one array  must be of the same data type.</p>

        <p>One of the things about arrays you have to know is that you can't just put any amount
        of things you want. When you declare an array, you must include the size that you want
        that array to be. In other words, you are telling the computer how many items are allowed
        to be in that array. Here's an example:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int myArray[20];</p>
        </div>

        <p>In this example we are telling the computer that the array will hold integers (int), it
        will be referenced by the name myArray and it will hold 20 integers.</p>

        <p>This is a very useful tool in programming because of the ability to hold multiple pieces
        of data and allows us to condense it into one place instead of storing data into multiple
        variables. Here is another example but this time it will actually be storing numbers:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int numbers[5] = {23, 6, 1, 98, 42};</p>
        </div>

        <p>You might be wondering how we might be able to access the data in an array. Good question!
        That's just where I was going next. Each piece of data in an array will be at a different
        index of the array and that is how we can access the data. The one weird thing that will take
        some getting used to is that the start of an array is at the index of 0, not 1 like you would
        think it would be. Here's an example of how to access all five of the integers in the array
        that we initialized above us:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int firstNumber = numbers[0];</p>
            <p>int secondNumber = numbers[1];</p>
            <p>int thirdNumber = numbers[2];</p>
            <p>int fourthNumber = numbers[3];</p>
            <p>int fifthNumber = numbers[4];</p>
        </div>

        <p>All of those variables would now hold the corresponding integers that it was assigned.
        Here try out some of these problems that we laid out for you. Good luck!</p>

        <p>Given the follow code:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int numberList[4] = {76, 2, 67, 8};</p>
            <p>int chosenNumber = numberList[3];</p>
            <p>printf(“chosenNumber: %d”, chosenNumber);</p>
        </div>

        <p>What will the printed output be?</p>
        <div id = "quiz">
            <div id = "quiz-options">
                <p class = "quiz-answer">76</p>
                <p class = "quiz-answer">2</p>
                <p class = "quiz-answer">67</p>
                <p class = "quiz-answer">8</p>
            </div>

            <div id = "quiz-solution"></div>
