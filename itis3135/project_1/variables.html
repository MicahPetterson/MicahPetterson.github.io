        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <p>Oh variables, one of the most basic building blocks of programming. Variables are what we use
        to hold data in a program, we can use variables to manipulate this data in many different ways.
        Whether it be to do math using them, use them to store data that the user inputs, and many other
        things. As you will see, variables are very very very important to every programming language
        and is how we do anything productive in programs. First we will start with how to initialize,
        which means to give a variable data, or to put it into the program that you are writing.</p>
        <p>Say we have a variable that we want to name “number” that we will use to store the number 5 in a program.</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int number = 5;</p>
        </div>

        <p>You will see a couple of things that we haven't mentioned yet, “int” and the semicolon at the
        end of the statement. We will start by discussing what “int” means and what other words we can
        use when we are declaring variables. We call these words data types and this table will show
        you the different data types in C and what data can be stored in them.</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Data Type Name</th>
                <th>C Keyword</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Examples</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Integer</td>
                <td>int</td>
                <td>Can store whole number, no decimals</td>
                <td>
                    <p>5</p>
                    <p>102</p>
                    <p>7</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Float</td>
                <td>float</td>
                <td>Can store numbers with decimals up to 6-7 decimal digits</td>
                <td>
                    <p>5.1234</p>
                    <p>1.5</p>
                    <p>10.82</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Double</td>
                <td>double</td>
                <td>Can store numbers with decimals up to 15 decimal digits</td>
                <td>
                    <p>3.14159265359</p>
                    <p>21.987</p>
                    <p>15.9132657</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Character</td>
                <td>char</td>
                <td>Can store a single character, letter, or number</td>
                <td>
                    <p>'H'</p>
                    <p>'&'</p>
                    <p>'1'</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><em>String</em></td>
                <td>N/A</td>
                <td>String is a little bit different in C that in
                other languages because it is not an actual declaration
                but is an array of characters</td>
                <td>
                    <p>"Hello"</p>
                    <p>"C is great!"</p>
                    <p>"My name is"</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>The semicolon that we discussed in the last paragraph is what is used to end every statement
        in C. It is very important that they are used to end every line because it is what tells
        the computer that a statement is finished, so it will not run without any semicolons.</p>

        <p>There you have it! Now that you understand variables better we can move on to even better
        things. Now remember that since variables are one of the most basic building blocks of
        programming, you are gonna need to remember how to write these statements to store data within
        your programs. You can always refer back to this page to help clarify some things if you don't remember.</p>
        
        <h2>Printing</h2>

        <p>We are also going to talk about printing on this page. Now I'm not gonna lie, printing is a
        little bit more annoying in C than in many other languages, but it's not that bad. Now you
        may be asking, “What is printing?”. Good question! It is something we do when we want to
        print the output to where we can see it. So that may be the console, the console inside of
        an IDE, etc. but whatever is being printed will be seen by the user. This is the code we
        would use to print something out:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>("Hello World!");</p>
        </div>

        <p>This would print out:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            Hello World!
        </div>

        <p>Printing is very useful in programming as it allows the user to actually be involved with
        the code that has been written. It can be more tricky when you want to print out a variable
        because a little bit more is needed. In order to add a variable to a print statement, we need
        to specify its data type using the “%” operator followed by a letter telling the computer
        what kind of variable it is. One more thing needs to be added, after the quotes you will add
        a comma followed by the variable name. Like so:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int x = 5;</p>
            <p>printf(“This number is %d”,x);</p>
        </div>

        <p>Here are the symbols for the different data types:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Data Type</th>
                <th>Symbol</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>char</td>
                <td>%c</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>int</td>
                <td>%d or %i</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>float</td>
                <td>%f</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>double</td>
                <td>%f</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><em>string</em></td>
                <td>%s</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
