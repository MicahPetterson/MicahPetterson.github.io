        <h1>Loops</h1>

        <p>Ah, loops. Now these are pretty fun, I'm not gonna lie. Loops do exactly what you think
        they do when you first hear the term, they loop! Now they don't just loop on forever but
        you will see in a minute what I am talking about. There are two basic types of loops in C,
        for loops and while loops. There are pretty distinct differences between the two and they
        should be used in different circumstances. We are going to start off talking about for loops.</p>

        <h2>For Loops</h2>

        <p>For Loops are the loops that you are probably going to see the most of early on as they
        are used for lots of things. Loops may sound like a thing that is not very important but
        you will soon find out just how important they are and how much you need them to do so many
        things. Let's start out with the basic setup of a for loop. I am going to provide the code
        skeleton first and then explain the different parts later.</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>for (iterator variable; condition; increment iterator)</p>
            <p>{</p>
            <p class = "indented-code">loop content;</p>
            <p>}</p>
        </div>

        <p>Here is one filled out for you,</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)</p>
            <p>{</p>
            <p class = "indented-code">int sum = sum + 10;</p>
            <p>}</p>
        </div>

        <p>Now, you may be wondering what these are actually useful for. Well one of the major uses
        is to iterate through (or look through) an array. We have the ability to view whatever is
        in each spot of an array and do whatever we want with that data. For example, let's assume
        we have an array of integers named numbers and it already has multiple values inside of it.
        Imagine you wanted to take each one of these numbers and add them together to get the sum
        of all of the integers in numbers. This is what it might look like,</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int sum = 0;</p>
            <p>for (int i = 0; i < sizeOf(numbers); i++)</p>
            <p>{</p>
            <p class = "indented-code">sum += number[i];</p>
            <p>}</p>
        </div>

        <p>To give you an understanding of how this might work, type any positive whole number in
        the blank below. Then, click the "Run" button, and you will see the sum of all the numbers
        from 0 to the number you entered, all thanks to this for loop!.
        </p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int yourNumber = <input type = "number" id = "loop-number">;</p>
            <p>int sum = 0;</p>
            <p>for (int i = 0; i <= yourNumber; i++)</p>
            <p>{</p>
            <p class = "indented-code">sum += i;</p>
            <p>}</p>
            <p>printf("Sum: %d", sum);</p>
        </div>

        <input type = "button" value = "Run" id = "run-button" onclick = "runLoop()">
        <p id = "loop-caption"></p>

        <p id = "loop-output-label">Output:</p>
        <div class = "code-block" id = "loop-output"></div>

        <p>In the previous function, we are iterating through the array by putting 'i' inside the
        brackets next to the array name. Since we are trying to sum all of the numbers in the array
        together we need to continue adding each number to a variable named 'sum'. This will
        iterate through the entire length of the array because as part of the conditional we stated
        that the loop will keep going while 'i' is still less than the size of the array. If you
        are wondering how we did that, it was the sizeOf() function which tells the computer the
        size of the array that we put in it.</p>

        <p>Now that you know the fundamentals of the For loop, we are going to talk about While loops.</p>

        <h2>While Loops</h2>

        <p>So you might be wondering why there are different types of loops and what the different uses
        of these might be. For loops are very useful when you already know the amount of times you need
        to loop, and while loops are useful when you don't know the amount of times you need to loop.
        Now this will not really be a need for you so early in your programming career but it is still
        useful knowledge to know how to build and use a while loop. Here is the basic outline for a while loop:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>while (controller)</p>
            <p>{</p>
            <p class = "indented-code">(statement to loop through);</p>
            <p>}</p>
        </div>

        <p>Now obviously this example doesn't show you exactly how it might work so let's explore it a
        little more. The controller statement is what allows the loop to actually run. As long as the
        controller statement is true then the loop will continue to run. Let's look at another example:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int i = 0;</p>
            <p>while (i < 5)</p>
            <p>{</p>
            <p class = "indented-code">printf(“i is %d”, i);</p>
            <p class = "indented-code">i++;</p>
            <p>}</p>
        </div>

        <p>Now the loop I just showed you could be accomplished as a for loop but that's okay for now.
        You really just need to know these two types of loops for now.</p>

        <p>One of the major differences between for loops and while loops that we haven't talked about
        yet is when the loops check the condition statement. For loops check the condition statement
        before it executes the statement inside the loop, meanwhile while loops check the condition
        after the statement is executed. This means that even if the condition is false a while loop
        will always run at least once. Now lets see if you can apply this knowledge by looking at this example:</p>

        <div class = "code-block">
            <p>int x = 5;</p>
            <p>for (int i = 0; i > 5; i++)</p>
            <p>{</p>
            <p class = "indented-code">System.out.println(“This loop is running”);</p>
            <p>}</p>
            <p class = "code-spacer"></p>
            <p>int counter = 0;</p>
            <p>while (counter > x)</p>
            <p>{</p>
            <p class = "indented-code">System.out.println(“No, this loop is running”);</p>
            <p>}</p>
        </div>

        <p>Now what will this program print out?</p>

        <div id = "loop-quiz">
            <div id = "loop-quiz-options">
                <div class = "code-block loop-quiz-option">
                    <div onclick = "loopAnswer(0)"><p>This loop is running</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class = "code-block loop-quiz-option">
                    <div onclick = "loopAnswer(0)"><p>This loop is running</p>
                    <p>No, this loop is running</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class = "code-block loop-quiz-option">
                    <div onclick = "loopAnswer(0)"><p>No, this loop is running</p></div>
                </div>
                <div class = "code-block loop-quiz-option">
                    <div onclick = "loopAnswer(1)"><p>[Neither loop will print anything.]</p></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id = "loop-quiz-solution">eee</div>
