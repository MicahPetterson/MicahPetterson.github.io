        <h3>Checklist</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                This submission does, in fact, lead directly to the webpage being reviewed.
            </li>
            <li>
                None of the folder or file names for this site contain spaces or uppercase letters.
            </li>

                Design:

                    <li>
                        The font size and its contrast with the site's background make it generally pretty easy to read for both
                        the actual content as well as the navigation bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The site uses a dedicated, linked CSS file for styling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This webpage fulfilled the CRAP principles overall quite well. As previously mentioned, contrast
                        between the text and the background allows for easy reading. Content layout is repeated and consistent
                        across all pages as well, ensuring an overall consistent experience. The content is also clearly divided,
                        so that users can tell what information is linked to which sections of the page.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                The site has a header, main, and a navigation bar, but does not have any footer.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site does, correctly so, not use the page names in the header, and instead only contains the site name on all pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                The main page, like the others, correctly does not use the site's overall name in the h2, instead just using the name of
                the individual page.
            </li>
            <li>
                This site does not seem to have a tagline.
            </li>
            <li>
                This site's pages do not have footers.
            </li>
            <li>
                This site meets the requirements for the assignment, maybe save for the lack of a footer.
            </li>
