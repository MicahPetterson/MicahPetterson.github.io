        <h3>Checklist</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                This submission does, in fact, lead directly to the webpage being reviewed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Save for the JavaScript files, none of the folders or other files contain spaces or uppercase letters.
                The JavaScript files contain uppercase letters, but is a detail I would personally dismiss, as one of the used
                JavaScript files is the "HTMLInclude.js" file we have been using for our main sites, which would
                serve as a precedent for capitalizing letters in other JavaScript file names.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design:
                <ol class = "lettered-list">
                    <li>
                        The font size and its contrast with the site's background make it easy to read for both the actual content
                        as well as other elements, such as the navigation bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The site uses a dedicated, linked CSS file for styling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This webpage fulfilled the CRAP principles overall pretty well. As previously mentioned, contrast
                        between the text and the background allows for easy reading. Content layout is repeated and consistent
                        across all pages as well, ensuring an overall consistent experience. The only thing I could think to note
                        would be that there seems to be no padding or margin between the text and the body or html item, which
                        causes the context to be right up against the edge of the screen. This is a minor detail, however, and might
                        even be something the designer already intends to change.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                The site has a header, main, footer, and a navigation bar as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site does, correctly so, not use the page names in the header. There is not an actual logo in the header,
                but there is a placeholder for one.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most pages on this site do start with the name of the page itself contained in an h2 element. The one exception
                is the About page, the h2 of which I would consider equally fitting anyway.
            </li>
            <li>
                This page does not seem to have a tagline.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site's footer contains the design firm name as well as the HTML and CSS validation links.
            </li>
            <li>
                This site meets the requirements for the assignment.
            </li>
