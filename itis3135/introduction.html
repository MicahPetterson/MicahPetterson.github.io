            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Personal Background: </strong>Born and raised in the far, far away land of Lincolnton, NC.
                    Second oldest, the singular male out of five siblings. As an interesting contrast to how
                    much I enjoy the methodical, problem-solving nature of programming, I also do creative writing,
                    art, and occasionally electronic music composition (despite the constant fight for the scarce
                    resources that are motivation and inspiration).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Professional Background: </strong>With each semester, it seems I am becoming more of an
                    abnormality as a student who has yet to acquire any professional experience in my field of study,
                    but I programmed a few simple projects back in high school. Aside from that, I currently make a
                    mean walking front counter in the Chick-fil-A drive-thru (sans making the drinks).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Academic Background: </strong>Proudly homeschooled since the 5th grade and started dual
                    enrollment with community college in the middle of high school. Graduated in 2021, got my Associates
                    in Science from Gaston College in 2022, and transferred to UNC Charlotte starting in the fall of
                    last year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong>Windows 11 because I was forced along the update
                    pipeline by my own software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>ITSC2181 - Introduction to Computer Systems: </strong>Because after all this time I
                            still know shamefully little about actual hardware.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>ITSC3146 - Introduction to OS & Networking: </strong>Because I need to get out of
                            the house more (the house being the same Microsoft Windows bubble I’ve been trapped
                            inside since XP).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>ITIS4350 - Rapid Prototyping: </strong>Because <s>apparently I haven’t been
                            prototyping fast enough</s> I need to learn how to quickly and efficiently knock out designs
                            for interfaces.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: </strong>I'm that guy. You know, The Guy Who Hauls
                    A Gaming Laptop Around Everywhere. But come on, it's portable.
