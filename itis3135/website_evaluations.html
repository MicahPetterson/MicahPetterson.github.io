            <h3><a href = "http://www.007museum.com">James Bond 007 Museum</a></h3>
            <p>This website serves to promote and advertise for the
            James Bond 007 Museum, located in Sweden. The site gives the user an expansive
            view of all that their exhibitions have to offer, and what anyone visiting
            the museum can expect to see. The website also seems to serve as a general
            news outlet for the James Bond movies, cast, and anything else related to
            the franchise.</p>
            <h4>CRAP</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong> - This site does a rather acceptable job
                at keeping content in contrast with its context. The background is a
                solid white, and all of the text is either black or a strong blue, which
                keeps everything easily discernable for the user.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong> - The site doesn't do a particularly great
                job at keeping a consistent pattern with its content. While the site follows
                a (very, very rough) pattern of images with headings above them, the text color,
                alignment, and font vary with each occurence.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong> - Frankly, this website does a pretty terrible
                job at alignment. Virtually every image has a radically different aspect ratio
                from the others, the text varies sporadically from center-aligned to left-aligned
                and everything in between, and any bit of content inside a bordered element
                is positioned very awkwardly within it.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong> - Finally, proximity is executed rather
                atrociously in this website as well. There are no indicators of what kind
                of groups of content the site could or even should be divided up into. The main
                page is simply one <em>very</em> long patchwork of various James Bond-related bits
                of information, with no real distinguishment between each item or how any of
                them connect to one another in any way.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a href = "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com">SCP Foundation Wiki</a></h3>
            <p>This is a collaborative sci-fi writing website used to hold the collective works of
            all participants of the project of the "SCP Foundation". The site stores fiction articles,
            short stories, and works of art as well as forums dedicated to the purpose of cultivating
            the community of writers and artists that contribute to the site.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>CRAP</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong> - This website does a great job with contrast, keeping a
                rather consistent theme of either black or dark red on white that clearly distinguishes
                the content from its background or context. Black or dark red text on a white surface is
                very easily readable for virtually all users.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong> - Not only is the color scheme consistent for this site,
                but so are the more graphical elements. All across the site, the designers utilized repeated
                visual design to provide a consistent theme that the user can become familiar with as the
                navigate from page to page.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong> - The alignment for this site is also executed very well. Each
                module of information is store in a box that forms a neat gridwork with all of the others, allowing
                the user's eyes to navigate more smoothly across the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong> - This site also uses proximity very effectively, making sure to
                group together like pieces of content. For example, the navigation bar, social media links, and actual
                content are all clearly divided into their own sections on the main page.</li>
